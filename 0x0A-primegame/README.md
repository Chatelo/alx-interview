# 0x0A. Prime Game

## Overview

Maria and Ben are playing a game where they take turns choosing a prime number from a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n. They remove the chosen number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game. The goal of this project is to determine, given a number of rounds and corresponding sets, who wins the most rounds. The players play optimally, and Maria always goes first.
